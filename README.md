# Original Site
My original portfolio, developed pre-course to showcase HTML, CSS and JS basics.

The site was developed pre-course, with some additional changes during weeks 1 and 2. It features a laser-shooting mini-game where users are able to destroy certain elements of the site, much to the site avatar's dismay.
The mini-game was created using a canvas underlay and event listeners. The co-ordinates are converted to the document space, and each destructable element is initiated and destroyed in JS after detecting a collision.

The site is fully responsive.
